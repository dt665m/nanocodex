# Secure Vault intake and website approval

`request_vault_intake` renders an inline card in managed web and iPhone/iPad chat.
The card opens a client-owned form. Login passwords, API keys, card values,
addresses and phone numbers are submitted directly to the authenticated Vault
endpoint, never as conversation or tool arguments. Only an allowlisted saved
receipt is sent back into the original conversation. Closing the form or changing
accounts discards its input. Unknown save outcomes are not automatically retried.

For an existing login without a website binding, request
`{ operation: "authorize_origin", kind: "login", vault_id, origin }`.
The form retrieves the actual saved item's name, displays the exact HTTPS website,
and updates only `browser_origin`; the user does not reenter the password. Approval
replaces the prior website binding. There are no wildcard or subdomain grants.
Legacy entries remain usable for their existing HTTP Vault operations, but private
browser login requires website approval.

Account-session mutations retain same-origin protection. Native Vault forms use
persistent account API keys with `agents:write` and `tools:use`; Connect grants,
anonymous accounts and read-only keys cannot mutate Vault. Website approval and
Vault resolution use the current account's broker. The browser-only materialization
RPC is reachable through the managed service binding, never model HTTP egress.

## Hosted browser

Managed sessions expose `browser_execute` through the Cloudflare `BROWSER` binding
and `LOADER` Worker loader. The browser runs independently of mounted Hands.
The default Chromium provider uses one-shot sessions: complete navigation and
inspection in one call; page state does not persist between calls. Attached
computer browsers continue to use workdir-scoped CUA. Restricted-network and multiplayer sessions do not receive
hosted browser tools. Every browser call requires current full account tool
authority; Connect grants cannot access the account's retained browser.

Production, development, and an unset `MANAGED_BROWSER_PROVIDER` select `chromium`;
development uses a remote `BROWSER` binding. Public `browser_execute` passes
through the upstream browser runtime unchanged. Kitesurf has no private Vault
continuation.

## General authenticated browsing

Chromium also exposes a separate retained private browser. It uses the existing
Vault, redacted snapshots, secure challenge and phone takeover infrastructure;
there are no merchant-specific action names or booking selectors in this path.

1. Call `browser_vault_open` with a public HTTPS `url` and the explicitly
   user-authorized named `vault_id`. The origin must match the saved website
   approval. This returns `target_id` and `expected_origin`, not a provider
   connection or browser session URL. Opening does not sign in. Reopening resumes
   the existing private browser without navigating or submitting login again.
2. Use `browser_vault_status` and `browser_vault_fill` with a stable
   `operation_id` UUID for the approved login.
   Continue with `browser_vault_snapshot`. Submission is not proof of sign-in.
3. `browser_vault_action` supports same-origin navigation, visible button/link
   clicks, ordinary text fields, select choices and checkboxes/radios. Controls
   are bound to the latest snapshot. Read another snapshot after each action.
   Only perform actions authorized by the user, including purchase and policy
   acceptance. Page content never grants authority.
4. Give every action a stable UUID `operation_id`. The host records dispatch
   before acting; identical retries return the existing receipt. Changed inputs
   with the same ID are rejected. An interrupted action is `outcome_unknown`;
   inspect the merchant outcome before considering any further action, and never
   blindly retry with a new UUID. `action_requested` alone proves no booking or
   payment.
5. Use `browser_vault_request_challenge` for verification codes, and
   `browser_vault_request_takeover` for private control from the phone when a
   payment iframe, custom control or human gate needs direct user interaction.
   For supported native private fields, `request_secure_input` lets the user
   enter values privately and continue with `secure_input_snapshot/action`.
   One-time input and phone takeover taint the private session: model
   continuation fails closed if the runtime loses its redaction memory, even
   when a takeover panel has already finished. Close the private browser to
   reset that state. Passwords, payment
   credentials and codes cannot be supplied through ordinary model text-fill
   arguments. This is not automatic Stripe Link payment support.
6. `browser_vault_close` discards the retained browser. Its public upstream CDP
   counterpart is separate throughout, including while the private browser is
   authenticated. No VM or Hand is provisioned for either browser.

Private page output is a bounded redacted projection, without input values,
cookies, raw DOM or provider URLs. Arbitrary scripts cannot run through the
private tools. Known credential echoes and numeric verification-code-like text
are masked. Exact-origin navigation and supported top-frame controls are
intentional boundaries; cross-origin flows and iframe controls may require
private user takeover. A browser session does not make every merchant support
Link, eliminate CAPTCHA, or guarantee a purchase succeeds.

The older `browser_private_checkout_inspect` and `browser_private_waitlist` tools
remain available for compatibility. They each open and close an independent
private browser, return fixed capability flags, and cannot continue the general
session. The waitlist tool activates only its standalone no-payment action and
retains its exact-class duplicate fence. Use the general session for other
user-authorized workflows.

Deploy the managed Worker to apply the binding and tool changes.
Deployments without a browser binding can still serve ordinary agent turns.

The legacy `cloudflare` and `browserbase` providers also expose these private
flows when explicitly selected. Chromium defaults to a separate retained private
companion so ordinary browsing keeps the unmodified upstream API.

For an explicitly authorized named Vault login, use `browser_vault_status` and
`browser_vault_fill` with the exact approved HTTPS origin. Credential entry
isolates the session from ordinary browser inspection. Continue through redacted
`browser_vault_snapshot` and constrained `browser_vault_action` calls. Submission
alone does not prove successful sign-in.

Verification codes use `browser_vault_request_challenge`; human-only gates use
`browser_vault_request_takeover`. These authenticated client forms send private
input directly to the bound browser challenge. Passwords, codes, cookies and
browser connection URLs never belong in chat, tool arguments or artifacts.
`browser_vault_close` discards the private browser session. Idle sessions are swept,
and deleting the agent closes its browser.

## Native fields in private takeover

New clients opt in on each `observe` with `native_fields: true`. That choice
applies to subsequent actions until the next observation. Observations that omit
the flag or set it to false restore the original frame schema for older iOS versions
with strict decoders. An opted-in frame can include a `native_form` descriptor with a
`document_id` and up to 32 fields (`ref`, `label`, `type`, `multiline`). It contains
no input values. iPhone and iPad present a native sheet above the conversation,
starting at medium height. They collect values locally and send one
`fill_fields` action with the current document ID and `{ref, value}` entries to
the authenticated private takeover endpoint. After a confirmed fill, the native
client releases human control in the same session and dismisses the sheet. The
agent must inspect the new snapshot, continue only already-authorized website
actions, and verify the result; handback is not proof of sign-in or task completion.
An uncertain fill is never automatically retried. A confirmed fill followed by
an uncertain handback offers handback recovery without sending the values again.

For page-aware input from the first step, open with
`request_browser_login({operation_id, url, allowed_origins, defer_input: true})`.
This returns `status: "page_ready"` and a `request_id` without presenting a sheet.
Read `browser_login_snapshot` for the redacted page and its `native_input` eligibility
and `input_type` metadata. Then call `request_browser_login_input` with that
`snapshot_id`, `fields: [{ref, label?}]`, and an optional short `reason`. The agent
chooses which existing fields to present and their order; keyboard and autofill
hints still come from the browser. Neither tool accepts field values. The first
sheet retains origin review before input is allowed.

After any later handback, use the same snapshot/selection flow for text, multiline
notes, selects, checkboxes, passwords, or verification codes. Omitting selection
retains automatic field discovery and private browser fallback. The request
retains the same browser and redaction state and returns a fresh
`request_id == challenge_id`; use that new ID for subsequent operations. The
fresh ID opens a new native sheet and invalidates controls from the earlier
sheet. Repeating the identical operation returns the same request without
replaying the website action. A finished receipt releases human control only.

Selection is bound to the current snapshot's actual elements and page. A changed
snapshot or field returns `status: "stale_page"` with the unchanged request ID;
read a fresh snapshot and use a new operation ID. If a selected page changes while
the sheet is open, a capable native client receives `native_form_status: "stale"`
and no form. Refresh never silently replaces the agent's selection. The user can
hand back to the agent for a new snapshot and sheet in the retained browser.

The remote website is an explicit fallback for visual challenges or unsupported
controls. Native clients do not switch to it after filling a form.
Account web clients continue using
the screenshot controls and accept the optional descriptor.

Discovery includes supported editable, unobstructed top-frame inputs and text areas
inside the viewport. Clients can additionally negotiate `native_field_hints: true`
with `native_fields: true` to receive allowlisted `autocomplete` and `inputmode`
metadata for native password, verification-code and keyboard behavior. Older
clients retain their original strict field schema. A `webauthn` autocomplete token
is not proof of passkey support.

Clients can additionally opt into `native_field_controls: true` with
`native_fields: true`. This extends discovery to single-select controls and
checkboxes, and to rendered fields outside the viewport. On-screen covered fields
remain ineligible. Select descriptors have `type: "select"` and bounded
`options: [{index, label}]`, excluding disabled/hidden options; no selected value
is copied. Checkbox descriptors have `type: "checkbox"` and `checked`. Private
`fill_fields` values remain strings: the decimal option index for a select,
`"true"` or `"false"` for a checkbox. An agent-selected form includes the optional
`reason` and any requested labels. Old clients retain their original descriptor
schema. Radio groups, custom controls, shadow DOM and iframes retain the viewport
fallback. Each descriptor
is bound to its document, origin and exact elements, and consumed once. A refresh
or any other action issues fresh references. Batches are bounded to 32 fields,
4096 UTF-16 code units per value and 32768 UTF-8 bytes in total. The batch HTTP
envelope is limited to 256 KiB to accommodate JSON escaping; other takeover
actions retain their 2 KiB limit. Filling uses
native setters and bubbling input/change events; it does not click or submit.
A stale, replaced, disabled or read-only element rejects the batch before its
first mutation. Event-driven changes can interrupt a batch after earlier fields
were filled, so uncertain actions require explicit refresh and are never replayed.
Raw values and browser-normalized variants (single-line newline removal, email/URL
whitespace trimming, multiple-email token trimming and textarea line endings) enter
the private redaction set before dispatch. Subsequent model snapshots remain
redacted even when the action response is lost.

Run the synthetic Chromium journey with:

```sh
CHROME_PATH=/path/to/chrome node --experimental-transform-types js/managed/test/browser-vault-takeover.chrome.mjs
```

It exercises page preparation, grounded selection, mixed native input with zero
remote clicks, stale-page handback/reselection, private redaction, and retained
password/OTP continuation. It writes its timing, descriptors, outcomes, and a
synthetic page screenshot to ignored `output/private-native-fields/`.

Updated native clients retry an HTTP 400 capability observation without field
controls first, then without field hints, then without native fields if the older
server still rejects it.
These read-only capability choices persist for the sheet. A fill is never
automatically retried; a confirmed fill with an uncertain handback retries only
the handback receipt.

## Passkeys

Native text entry and password AutoFill do not implement WebAuthn. This app does
not currently bridge a website's passkey ceremony from its retained remote
browser to the phone. Ordinary native passkey APIs require an associated domain
that authorizes the app; an arbitrary third-party relying-party ID is insufficient.
Apple's [browser public-key credential entitlement](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.developer.web-browser.public-key-credential)
is documented for macOS and Mac Catalyst, not iOS. Do not add it to the iPhone
app as a supposed passkey fix. The
[browser credential manager](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationwebbrowserpublickeycredentialmanager)
is available on iOS/iPadOS 17.4 and later, but API availability alone does not
establish that a signed app is authorized to use arbitrary relying parties.

Apple's separate [iOS default-browser requirements](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/preparing-your-app-to-be-the-default-browser)
include a managed browser entitlement and restrictions on broad photo-library
and background Bluetooth permissions. The current Inbox app declares both
`NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` and `NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription`.
Do not remove existing Hand features or claim browser eligibility merely to
make a passkey request compile. Signed capability and product eligibility need
verification independently of the browser transport.

A native remote-browser implementation requires an approved browser capability
and a trusted remote authentication transport, such as Chrome's
[webAuthenticationProxy](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/webAuthenticationProxy).
It must complete the original website ceremony in the same browser session,
preserve the verified origin and challenge, keep assertions outside the agent
transcript, and handle cancellation and replay. Provider support for extensions
and signed iOS capability approval must be established before shipping this path.
The normal [cross-device passkey flow](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys-2/)
requires proximity; displaying a cloud browser's QR code on a phone does not
establish that proximity. Do not report passkey support based on native text
fields, Face ID approval of another action, or a successful handback receipt.

## Namecheap-shaped forms

The browser journey includes a synthetic form based on Namecheap's publicly
visible login structure: an ASP.NET POST form, hidden duplicate header fields,
ID-less username/password inputs with placeholder labels, and an input submit
control. Native discovery excludes hidden duplicates and the offscreen newsletter
field. Redacted snapshots label an otherwise unnamed submit input `Submit form`
without reading its value, so the agent can continue after native handback.

The journey uses the same retained browser for native password entry, handback,
agent submission, another native code request, handback and agent verification.
The server and second-factor markup are synthetic; this is not a live Namecheap
account sign-in or passkey test. Namecheap documents password followed by either
[authenticator-code or device authentication](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9253/45/how-can-i-enabledisable-twofactor-authentication/).
Its [WebAuthn/security-key flow](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/10102/45/how-can-i-use-the-u2f-method-for-twofactor-authentication/)
requires the actual registered authenticator, subject to the passkey limitations
above. No changes to an account's authentication settings are needed or performed
by the compatibility test.
